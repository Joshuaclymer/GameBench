<h1> Chain Reaction </h1>

<h2>Game Summary</h2>
The objective of the game is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' orbs.
Players take turns to place their orbs in a cell on the board.
When a cell has reached critical mass the orbs explode into the surrounding cells, adding an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player.
A player may only place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that contains orbs of their own colour.
Once a player loses all their orbs they are out of the game. Last one with all orbs of their colour on the board wins.
